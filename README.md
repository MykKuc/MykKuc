- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mykolas.
- :hammer: My first project on AWS: employeemanagementapp.com ; www.employeemanagementapp.com
- :hammer: My second (upcoming) project on AWS: "Things are for sale"
- :pencil2: I have completed the Devbridge Sourcery Academy for developers. I learned about developing using Spring Boot, React.js, working with Agile methodology, presenting the finished project. 
- ðŸ‘€ My main focus is Java programming language. I want to learn as much as possible about it's different versions, features, ways to create applications using it. Also, I am learning Spring Framework and the different sub-parts (Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, etc.) of it.
- ðŸ”§ The tools that I am learning or using in my projects include: IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Apache Maven, Apache Tomcat, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), JUnit, Elasticsearch, Docker.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to acquire as much knowledge as possible about all these technologies, tools and best applications of them while developing software.
- âž• Also I am learning some frontend development using React.js or Angular (some companies want full-stack developers or ask for some knowledge, so I have to learn some front-end also despite focusing on Java) , but my main focus is still Java and Spring Framework.
- :cloud: I am also learning and using some cloud technologies. My only focus is Amazon Web Services. I use Route 53, CloudFront, S3, EC2 (Ubuntu) Instances and Amazon RDS to host my project (employeemanagementapp.com).
